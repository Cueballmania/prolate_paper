\begin{abstract}
In this study, we present a direct method to calculate molecular resonance energies and lifetimes for the molecular anions N$^{-}_2$ and CO$_2^{-}$ on a finite element discrete variable representation (FE-DVR) grid by using exterior complex scaling (ECS).
The calculations were preformed by making the separable approximation to the potentials from Hartree-Fock quantum chemistry codes on the neutral target to calculate the complex energies in the static exchange approximation where the target orbitals of the neutral remained unchanged.
Both molecules were placed on a prolate spheroidal grid where the ECS scaling was done on the radial-like variable $\xi$.
At equilibrium, the molecular resonance for N$_2^{-}$ appears at XXXX and the resonance energy for CO$_2$ appears at YYYY.
